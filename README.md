# BlazeServer - How to Use
Misaka_Mikoto_01 blaze server, ready for use.
Run the .exe (don't forget to also run the redirector!)
You WILL need a mysql server for this to work.
Run the bf3lan.sql in mysql.
Change the conf.txt so the blaze can connect to the mysql.

You should only change these 3:

dbhost=127.0.0.1 (USE IF: The server running blaze is also running the mysql server)
dbuser=root <- standard password and user
dbpass=root
